# Primary keys

The database automatically creates an index for the primary key.

The PostgreSQL operation Index Scan combines the INDEX [UNIQUE/RANGE] SCAN and TABLE ACCES BY INDEX ROWID operations from the Oracle Database. It is not visible from the execution plan if the index access might potentially return more than one row. After accessing the index, the database must do one more step to fetch the queried data (FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME) from the table storage: the TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID operation.

# Multi-column Indexes

A multi-column index is just a B-tree index like any other that keeps the indexed data in a sorted list. The database considers each column according to its position in the index definition to sort the index entries. The first column is the primary sort criterion and the second column determines the order only if two entries have the same value in the first column and so on.

The index excerpt in Figure 2.1 shows that the entries for subsidiary 20 are not stored next to each other. It is also apparent that there are no entries with SUBSIDIARY_ID = 20 in the tree, although they exist in the leaf nodes. The tree is therefore useless for this query.

Example:  
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX employees_pk
    ON employees (employee_id, subsidiary_id)  
If we use only subsidiary_id in a where clause, index will not be used.

Full table scan can be the most efficient operation in some cases, in particular when retrieving a large part of the table. This is partly due to the overhead for the index lookup itself, which does not happen for a full table scan operation. This is mostly because an index lookup reads one block after the other as the database does not know which block to read next until the current block has been processed. A FULL TABLE SCAN must get the entire table anyway so that the database can read larger chunks at a time (multi block read). Although the database reads more data, it might need to execute fewer read operations.

The PostgreSQL db uses two operations when reversing index and using (subsidiary_id, employee_id): a Bitmap Index Scan followed by a Bitmap Heap Scan. They roughly correspond to Oracle’s INDEX RANGE SCAN and TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID with one important difference: it first fetches all results from the index (Bitmap Index Scan), then sorts the rows according to the physical storage location of the rows in the heap table and then fetches all rows from the table (Bitmap Heap Scan). This method reduces the number of random access IOs on the table.

The query optimizer, or query planner, is the database component that transforms an SQL statement into an execution plan. This process is also called compiling or parsing. There are two distinct optimizer types.

Cost-based optimizers (CBO) generate many execution plan variations and calculate a cost value for each plan. The cost calculation is based on the operations in use and the estimated row numbers. In the end the cost value serves as the benchmark for picking the “best” execution plan.

Rule-based optimizers (RBO) generate the execution plan using a hard-coded rule set. Rule based optimizers are less flexible and are seldom used today.
